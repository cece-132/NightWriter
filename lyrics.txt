I ain't tryna be stubborn
But I could use some self loving
I ain't gotta say nothing
They already know how I'm coming
I been working on me
I been loving on me
I had to learn to love myself
And no, I don't mind no help
I'd rather do it myself
No, I don't mind no help
But I'd rather do it myself
I been working on me
I been loving on me
I had to learn to love myself
